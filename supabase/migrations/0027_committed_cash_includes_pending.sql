-- account_stats' v_committed_cash only summed trades with status = 'open',
-- but a pending limit/stop order already has its position_size set aside
-- for it (see scripts/seed-fake-data.mjs, which seeds pending trades with a
-- position_size the same as open ones) -- that money is reserved the moment
-- the order is placed, not just once it fills. Excluding pending orders
-- here made committed_cash (and therefore availableCash, and the new-trade
-- position-size prefill that spends it) overstate what's actually free by
-- whatever was sitting in pending orders.
--
-- Fixed in JS too (account/queries.ts's getAccountBalance) and mirrored
-- here so both agree. Only the v_committed_cash subquery's status filter
-- changes; everything else is identical to 0026.
